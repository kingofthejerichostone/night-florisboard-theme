# A Night-theme for [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard)

> My personal creation of dark/nightish theme for [FlorisBoard](https://github.com/florisboard/florisboard). I was probably the most influenced by the "Vim Dark Blue" theme from notepad++.

## Install

1.  Download the `Theawesomenighttheme.flex` file
1.  Open the FlorisBoard app
3.  Select "Theme"
4.  Change "Theme mode" to "Always night"
5.  Press on "Manage installed themes"
7.  Press import and find the `Theawesomenighttheme.flex` file downloaded earlier
8.  Now you should see "theme-1644135120738" as an option under the night theme menu, select the theme (yes I know I was not very creative with the name)
9.  Have fun!
